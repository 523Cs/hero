      <h1> This is Kjetil-Vidar Haraldstad, or also known as Frost in his band Satyricon. I picked him as my hero because his music has saved me just like many other artists have but him mainly. Even though his music is black metal and its mostly
        just screaming this music tends to help calm me down during some of my worst moments. Such as trying to create these websites last minute that has me screaming at the top of my lungs because my code never works and it frustrates me but its
        ok. And my poor friend Dylan has to witness my frustration over our calls and he just listens to me screaming as if im being stabbed because trying to get a few lines of code to work makes me so mad. Anyways, I just love Frost for who he is
        and as a person, even though he obviously doesn't know me or knows that his music has saved me I still will thank him for creating music. Even thouhg the songs don't have much meaning like deep meaning such as some of Melanie Martinez's songs
        I still love them. A few songs being K.I.N.G or The Wolfpack.
